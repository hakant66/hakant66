## Hi, I am Hakan Taskin üëã

### About Me: 
Solution Consultant and Presales Engineer by day, and a relentless code tinkerer by night. I blend sharp commercial insight with the joy of hands-on API delivery.

My sweet spot is the space where advanced AI models meet rock-solid engineering and we question about AI Regulations, Compliance, Privacy, and Ethical Concerns.  I love tearing down complex requirements and building elegant, performant solutions‚Äîespecially when they involve:

Serverless AI/ML APIs: Architecting scalable, cost-effective endpoints for models (fast is fun!).

LLMs & Generative AI: Exploring the boundaries of what's possible and building practical, enterprise-ready applications on top of foundation models.

MLeOps/DevOps: Ensuring models don't just run on my laptop but are reliably deployed, monitored, and versioned in the cloud.

If it involves an innovative AI solution and a clean API gateway, I'm already hooked.

### On Technology stack my Areas of interest: 
Recently I am specialising in Agentic AI, FastAPI, RAG and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ‚Äîwrapping REST APIs with guardrails so teams can use trusted data safely in LLM workflows.

### Core strengths: 
REST APIs, JSON, OAuth 2.0, API keys, JWT, FastAPI, FastMCP, pagination, rate limiting, retries/back-off ‚Ä¢ Python (requests, pandas), JavaScript, SQL ‚Ä¢ OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman, Insomnia, SQL for data wrangling and demo automation ‚Ä¢ Cloud familiarity (AWS, Azure) ‚Ä¢ Data quality & governance ‚Ä¢ Solution design ‚Ä¢ Discovery & scoping ‚Ä¢ Demos/PoCs ‚Ä¢ Stakeholder management ‚Ä¢ Clear, customised and audience‚Äëaware storytelling
